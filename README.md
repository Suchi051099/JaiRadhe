# Hybrid Cryptography 
With the increase in the amount of data produced, the storage space is always expanding; and owning and  managing this immense data is a tedious task. With this came the importance of cloud systems.
 With the cloud came the need for security. With more and more devices connecting on the internet, the risk of data being hampered increases.
Not just storing data, but storing data securely is the need of the hour.
 
My project aims to show how this need can be fulfilled. The cloud architecture is represented here using socket programming, where the two terminals act as client and server respectively.
When a client wants to store data in the cloud, it will upload the file to the cloud, where on receiving the file the cloud provider uses the public key to store the file in the encrypted format.
